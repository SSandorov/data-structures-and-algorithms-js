 * These algorithms attempt to find a solution to a problem by systematically trying all possible

//? Greedy algorithms

/*
* The basic definition of an algorithm implies that it is a well defined procedure to solve a problem or accomplish
* some task.
* The greedy algorithms may (or may not) achieve this
* This type of algorithms are usually applied to optimization problems. They differ from brute force algorithms by
* not trying all posibilities. Instead they choose the best possible choice in a specific moment in time (step 
* where a decision needs to be made)

* Under certain conditions these algorithms perform well and are successful
