//? Recursion
//* A function calls itself over and over, again and again, until it doesn't
/*
 *   Procedure to solve a recursive problem
 *       - Assume you already have a function that solves your problem
 *       - Find some simple base cases that you can solve directly without any complications
 *       - Figure out how you can solve the original problem by first solving one or more smaller
 *       versions of it
 *       - Apply your assumed function from step 1 to solve the minor problems of step 3, or if
 *       they are small enough, solve them as in step 2
